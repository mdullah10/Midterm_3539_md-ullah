Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A.To format organizing and storing data.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A.The most common operations performed on them are:
  Data insertion,Data update, Data retrieval.
List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A. Compiler Design,
   Operating System,
   Database Management System,
   Statistical analysis package,
   Numerical Analysis,
   Graphics,
   Artificial Intelligence,
   and Simulation.
what is an Array?
A. Array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type
what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A-> Array is a fixed length data structure while ArrayList is a variable length
   Collection class. ... 4- You can not store primitives in ArrayList, it can only contain
   Objects. While Array can contain both primitives and Objects in Java.
what is LinkedList?
A.  LinkedList class uses a doubly linked list to store the elements

How is an Array different from Linked List?
A.An array is the data structure that contains a collection of similar type data elements
 the Linked list is considered as non-primitive data structure contains a
 collection of unordered linked elements known as nodes. ... Operations
 like insertion and deletion in arrays consume a lot of time.
what is queue?
A. The Queue interface is available in java.util package and extends the Collection interface.
what is stack?
A.A Stack is a Last In First Out data structure.
  It supports two basic operations called push and pop
what is FIFO and LIFO?
A.FIFO is- First in first out. LIFO is-Last in first out
what is the order of complexity?
A.
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
A.The best case for a simple linear search on a list occurs when the desired
    element is the first element of the list
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
A. For an unsorted array, you have to search element by element, until the element
    is found or array is completely traversed.
what is tree in data structure?
A. Tree is a set of nodes storing elements such that the nodes have
    a parent-child relationship that satisfies the following.
what is graph in data structure?
A.A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
A. Hashtable is synchronized, HashMap is not synchronized.
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
A. The major data structures used are as follows:
  · RDBMS – Array (i.e. Array of structures)
  · Network data model – Graph
  · Hierarchical data model – Trees
How HashMap works in java?
A. It is a data structure which allows us to store object and retrieve it in constant time O(1)
     Objects are stored by calling put(key, value) method of HashMap
      and retrieved by calling get(key) method.
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
A. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs when we try to access an element of an array,
    with an index that is negative or more than the size of array
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
A.There are multiple ways to copy elements from one array in Java e.g.
    you can manually copy elements by using a loop, create a clone of the array,
    use Arrays.copyOf() method or System.arrayCopy() to start copying elements
    from one array to another in Java.
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
A.  Arrays are index based data structure where each element associated with an index.
    the link field holds the address of the next data item in the linked list.
What is DFS and BFS?
A. The breadth first search (BFS) and the depth first search (DFS)
What is Recursion?
A.Recursion is a basic programming technique you can use in Java,
    in which a method calls itself to solve some problem.
What are linear and non linear data Structures?
A.In the linear data structure, the data is organized in a linear order in which elements are linked one
    after the other. Non-linear data structure involves multiple levels.
     Examples of the linear data structure are array, queue, stack, linked list, etc
What is Big-(O)-notation?
A. Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a
    function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure
    feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
